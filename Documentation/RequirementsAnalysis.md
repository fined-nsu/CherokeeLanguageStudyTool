### Inspiration

This project draws from a few different sources of inspiration. One of those sources was from observation as a student in the Elementary Cherokee I course. Several students mentioned difficulty studying outside of the class period. While in class they were able to practice speaking with each other in Cherokee, but at home they didn't have another Cherokee speaker to practice with. They relied only on reading notes taken in class.

Another source of inspiration comes from hearing about the language preservation initiatives of the Cherokee Nation. As a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, and having heard many of the elder family members on my mothers side that were either first or second language speakers of Cherokee as I grew up, I have been inspired to take my own measures to learn more about the language. I feel a responsibility to do my part to aid in the preservation of the language.

The third source of inspiration centers around Sequoyah, the inventor of the Cherokee Syllabary. Several years ago a member of my family began genealogy research and discover a connection to Sequoyah. Tracing back around nine generations I found that he is my grandfather with several greats tacked on to that title. As a student at Northeastern State University many days I would pass by a statue of him in front of Seminary Hall while passing between classes. Knowing of the great contribution of the Syllabary that lead to literacy for the Cherokee people two hundred years ago I felt this project should include material to help learn the Syllabary as well.
