# Creating and Managing Word List Files

Word lists can be created using Notepad or any text editor that allows saving .txt files. New word lists can be imported in the Phonetic Practice mode, or from the Settings option under Help on the Main Menu.

New word list files need to contain, in order, the English, Phonetic, and Syllabary translation for each word. Each translation should be separated by a comma. A new line should be used for each word. New word list files with up to 30 lines are supported.

#### Here is an example of the contents of a word list file

Newly created word list files can be saved to any location and will be copied to the applications Resources\WordLists folder upon import. This means the word list only needs to be imported once.
