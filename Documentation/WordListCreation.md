# Creating new word list files

Word lists can be created using Notepad or any text editor that allows saving .txt files. New word lists can be imported in the Phonetic Practice mode, or from the Settings option under Help on the Main Menu.

The new word list file needs to contain, in order, the English, Phonetic, and Syllabary translation for each word. Each translation should be separated by a comma Currently new word list files up to 30 lines are supported.

#### Here is an example of the contents of a word list file
